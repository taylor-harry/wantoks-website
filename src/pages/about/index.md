  Welkam olgeta (welcome everyone)!  
  Canterbury PNG Wantoks Inc. is made up of Papua New Guinea families living, working and studying in Christchurch, South Island of New Zealand.  
  A group of volunteers make up the Executive Team to help run the association. Executive meetings are held at the end of each month except during festive season (ie: December – January).  
  Our goal is to bring together all Papua New Guineans and friends of PNG in Canterbury and wider New Zealand to:
  1.	Share our stories;
  2.	Teach and pass our culture onto our children, the future generation;
  3.	Organise and participate in important events such as our Independence Day to showcase our vast culture, language and food. 
  4.	And most importantly to stay in touch with each other.  
  Olgeta wantoks na poro man na meri (all our friends), feel free to contact us and be part of our bikpela (big) family lon (in) Christchurch, Garden City bilong (of) New Zealand.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...
